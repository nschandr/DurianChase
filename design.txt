Our game has a main character that is movable with courser keys.
Our moving entities are the main character, the helpers, and the bear. The entities that don’t move are the basket, trees, and fruit that spawn randomly.
How the game works is that you are trying to collect as many durian fruits as you can using the courser keys while a bear is chasing you. You will collect a durian when you approach it and the counter at the bottom left of the screen will increment to show the current amount of fruits you collected. You can also mouse click on an empty spot and a helper will appear to help you collect fruits. However, if you do this, leaves will appear and act as obstacles, and the bear will move a little bit faster every time a helper shows up. Only 10 fruits can be shown on the screen at once, and fruits are randomly spawned every few moments. The goal of this game is to collect as many durians as you can. If the bear gets you, it’s game over and there will be text that shows the final amount of fruits you collected.
We used Singleton for the main character since there can only be one instance of the main character. We also used Design Factory and created EntityFactory to simplify the creation of all of the entities.
